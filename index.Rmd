Welcome to the home of the Oxford R Users Group. We are dedicated to bringing together area practitioners of R to exchange knowledge, inspire new users, and spur the adoption of R for innovative research and commercial applications.

We are holding regular meetings on the first Monday of every month in the Dorfman room of St Peter's College, Oxford. For information about upcoming talks and events, please check our meetup page [meetup.com/Oxford-R-User-Group](https://www.meetup.com/Oxford-R-User-Group/) for latest information. Everyone is welcome!
